TypeSieve is a very lightweight implementation of a .NET assembly scanner. While the problem is simple and solution implementations are fairly common and similar, APIs differ in nearly every incarnation. The goal of TypeSieve is simply to provide a fluent API for type scanning that supports the most common operations. TypeSieve also supports a convention system for specifying more complex filtering scenarios that can then be included in your scan configuration using the same fluent API.

The recommended usage for open source projects or reusable assemblies is to use ILMerge to prevent conflicts between multiple assemblies that may depend on different versions of TypeSieve.
